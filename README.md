Predicting types of correct and incorrect answers for MATHE dataset


total_prd_answer_correct on test dataset
LR = 816+291 = 1107 = 57.96%
DT = 775+380 = 1155 = 60.47%
RF = 773+384 = 1157 = 60.58%
XGB = 773+383 = 1156 = 60.52%


*The dataset falls in underfitting due to less data.By comparing above calculations and using ROC Curve , Random Forest model is performed best in this all
